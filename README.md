# Typescript-project
Project for learning typescript 
Do the movie blog site with a Node/Typescript backend Hosted on AWS/Route 53

For front end --- React/Redux or Vue?

Better to learn 1 new thing or have a bunch of new things together?

Could always do something different in Vue that is more front end centered.

Use a REST API, probably save GraphQL for something else.

Some kind of Running app?
